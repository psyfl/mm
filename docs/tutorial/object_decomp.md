## Useful tools

We are very fortunate that several nice tools have been written recently that are excellent for documenting asset files:
- [Z64Utils](https://github.com/Random06457/Z64Utils/releases), for looking at displaylists, textures they reference, the skeleton, animations, etc.
- [Texture64](https://github.com/queueRAM/Texture64/releases), for looking at textures in all the common N64 formats (needed since Z64Utils cannot interpret textures not explicitly referenced in displaylists currently)
